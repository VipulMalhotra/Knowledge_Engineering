A collection of intrusion alerts investigated by a security operations center (SOC) team is given. Each record
is described by various statistics selected based on experts’ knowledge, and a hierarchy of associated IP
addresses (anonymized), called assets. For each alert in the ‘investigated alerts’ data tables, there is a history
of related log events (a detailed set of network operations acquired by SoD, anonymized to ensure the safety
of SoD clients). The dataset covers a period between October 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019.
